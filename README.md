Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering tools, principles and methods to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products.
software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

*The development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C)
* The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
* The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The software Development Life Cycle consists of the following phases:
Requirements: gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Implementation: writing code and building the software according to the design.
Testing: conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: releasing softwares to users or customers.
Maintenance: providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodologies deals with sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall, while agile methodologies follows iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
* Software Developer: Responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
* Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
* Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., visual Studio, eclipse)
VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
some of the common challenges faced by software engineers include:
* Changing requirements
* Tight deadlines
* Technical debts
  The strategies for overcoming these challenges include:
  * Effective communication
  * Agile methodologies
  * Prioritization of tasks
  * Regular assessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

* Unit Testing: It deals with testing individual components or modules of software
* Integration Testing: Has to do with testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
* System Testing: Involves testing the entire software system as a whole.
* Acceptance Testing: This deals with testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. Prompt engineering is essential for interacting with AI models because it ensures accurate, relevant, and efficient responses. It helps control the AI's output, enhances creativity, reduces bias, handles complex tasks, and improves the overall user experience. In short, it maximizes the effectiveness of AI interactions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

A vague prompt like "Tell me about scholarships" is too broad and leads to generic responses. An improved prompt, such as "List five scholarships for international students pursuing postgraduate Polymer 
science degrees in Canada for 2025, including eligibility and deadlines," is more effective because it is specific, concise, and focused, guiding the AI to deliver relevant and actionable information.
